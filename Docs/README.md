# Summaries

This directory contains summaries of various topics, organized into subdirectories. This is a personal project and collection of topics I was interested in learning about. I've created these summaries with the goal of making learning easier, particularly for visual learners like myself. They feature less complex explanations, many visuals, and other elements to aid comprehension. While this was initially for my own learning, I've made it public in case anyone else finds it helpful.
